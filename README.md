# Pac-man game

Created during Scrimba course (with many challenges during the course), but with better practices, somewhat shorter code, refactoring and module implementation (JavaScript).

Also, styling is updated so the game approximates original as closely as possible.

Please, let me know if you notice that there is any major flaw in the code or not a good practice.

Hope you like this!

P.S. I created a bunch of modules for better readability and practice.
