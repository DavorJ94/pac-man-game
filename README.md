# Pac-man game

Created during Scrimba course (with many challenges during the course), but with better practices, somewhat shorter code, refactoring and module implementation (JavaScript).

Game can be previewed by using the following link: https://davorj94.github.io/pac-man-game/

The buttons are added for smaller screen sizes so those the game would be optimized for touchscreens.

Also, styling is updated so the game approximates original as closely as possible.

Please, let me know if you notice that there is any major flaw in the code

Hope you like this!

P.S. I created a bunch of modules for better readability and for practice.
